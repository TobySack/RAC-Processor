### RAC Processor

A discontinued project I worked on. It is an android app that I wrote to automate tasks at work. We would often get Rent-A-Center sheets for devices to fix that we had to manually enter into a google doc. I made this to just snap a photo and use Google's API turn it into text and automatically update a google doc.
